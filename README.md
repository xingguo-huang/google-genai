- **Description**: Guides the user through building an agent using LangGraph, showcasing the integration of AI with structured data.

### 8. [day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api.ipynb](day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api.ipynb)
- **Description**: Explains how to implement function calling with the Gemini API, allowing for dynamic interactions.

### 9. [day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model.ipynb](day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model.ipynb)
- **Description**: Covers the process of fine-tuning a custom model using the Google GenAI API, including data preparation and training.

### 10. [Agents_Function_Calling_Barista_Bot.ipynb](Agents_Function_Calling_Barista_Bot.ipynb)
- **Description**: A practical example of using automatic function calling with the Gemini API to build a cafÃ© ordering system agent.

## Getting Started
To run the notebooks, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
%pip install -qU "google-genai>=1.0.0"
```

Make sure to set your API key in an environment variable or a Colab secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
